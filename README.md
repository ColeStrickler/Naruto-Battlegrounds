## Naruto-Battlegrounds
# Fight wave after wave of enemy shenobi as your favorite Naruto character!

# Disclaimer:
I used textures from the Game Boy Advance game Naruto: Ninja Council for the characters and enemies in this game. This idea came about when I was doing some housecleaning and I came across my old GBA cartridge of the original game. I tried to load it up on my original Game Boy but the system would not recognize it. Later on I began to google the game to reminisce and that is when I came across the texture files and decided to use them to make a game in Pygame.

# Characters
Currently I have only added my two favorite characters from the original Naruto show, Zabuza and Sasuke. Zabuza was only an enemy in the GBA game so I knew I needed to make him playable for this project. I may add more characters over time.

Each character has 3 attacks and an ultimate.

Use the attacks with 1,2,3. Use the ultimate with 4.
W,A,S,D are used to move. Spacebar is to jump.

# Enemies
Purple Ninja -> slow moving, jump, kick, punch roll attack, shuriken throw

Green Ninja -> tanky, teleports, charge attack, shuriken throw, punch attack, teleport

Pink Ninja -> fast, attacks and teleports away in a hit and run strategy

I may add boss fights in the near future to spice this up a bit
